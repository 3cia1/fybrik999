Currently, we officially support just OS X and Linux platforms. If you have a
Windows machine consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), a remote
Linux machine, or any other solution such as a virtual machine.


# Dependencies

Install the following on your machine:

1. [go 1.13.x](https://golang.org/dl/)
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
1. Maven and Java 8 or above
1. [Mac only] `brew install coreutils` (installs the timeout command)


# Editors

The project is predominantly written in Go so we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go) for its good Go support. Alternatively you can select from [Editors](https://golang.org/doc/editors.html)
