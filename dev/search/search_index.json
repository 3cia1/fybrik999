The figure below showcases the current architecture of the Mesh for Data platform, running on top of Kubernetes. The storage systems shown in the lower half of the figure are merely an example. The core parts of Mesh for Data are based on Kubernetes operators and custom resource definitions in order to define its work items and reconcile the state of them. The primary interaction object for a data user is the M4DApplication CRD where a user defines which data should be used for which purpose. The following chart and description describe the architecture and components of Mesh for Data relative to when they are used. Before the data user can perform any actions a data operator has to install the Mesh for Data and modules. Modules are an extensible mechanism for processing data. Modules can provide read/write access or produce implicit copies that serve as lower latency caches of remote assets. Modules also enforce policies defined for data assets. Mesh for Data connects to external services to receive policy engine decisions, available data and credentials. Policies, assets and access credentials to the assets have to be defined before the user can run an application. The current abstraction supports 2 different connectors but depending on the implementation the external system could be the same (e.g. a data catalog could store asset definitions and credentials). It's designed in an open way so that multiple different catalog and policy frameworks of all kinds of cloud and on-prem systems can be supported. The data steward configures policies in an external policy manager over assets defined in an external data catalog. Once a developer submits an M4DApplication CRD to Kubernetes the ApplicationController will make sure that all the specs are fulfilled and will make sure that the data is made accessible to the user according to the previously defined policies. The M4DApplication holds metadata about the application such the data assets required by the application, the processing purpose and the method of access the user wishes (protocol e.g. S3 or Arrow flight). It uses this information to check with external systems (4) if access or copy is allowed and whether restrictive policies such as masking or hashing have to be applied. It compiles blueprints based on on the policy decisions received via the connectors and chooses the modules (5) which are best fit for the requirements that the user specified regarding the access protocol and availability. As data assets may reside in different systems the blueprints are compiled in a Plotter CRD (6) that specifies which blueprints have to be executed in which cluster. Depending on the setup the PlotterController will use various methods to distribute the blueprints. In a multi cluster setup the default distribution implementation is using Razee to control remote blueprints, but several multi-cloud tools could be used as a replacement. The PlotterController also collects statuses and distributes updates of said blueprints. Once all the blueprints on all clusters are ready the plotter is marked as ready. A single blueprint contains the specification of all assets that shall be accessed in a single cluster by a single application. The BlueprintController makes sure that a blueprint can deploy all needed modules (8) and (9) and tracks their status (10). Once e.g. an implicit-copy module finishes the copy the blueprint is also in a ready state. A read or write module is in ready state as soon as the proxy service such as the arrow-flight module is running. In this example an implicit-copy module copies data from a remote postgres database into a S3 compatible ceph instance. The arrow-flight module then locally serves the data to the user via the Arrow flight protocol. Credentials are handled by the modules (11) and are never exposed to the user. The application reads from and writes data to allowed targets. Requests are handled by M4DModule instances(12). The application can not interact with unauthorized targets.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/architecture/#architecture","text":"Mesh for Data takes a modular approach to provide an open platform for controlling and securing the use of data across an organization.

This page describes what connectors are and what connectors are installed using the default Mesh for Data installation. What are connectors? Connectors are GRPC services that the Mesh for Data control plane uses to connect to external systems. Specifically, the control plane needs connectors to data catalog and policy manager. These connector GRPC services are deployed alongside the control plane. Can I write my own connectors? Yes. Mesh for Data provides some default connectors described in this page but anyone can develop their own connectors. A connector needs to implement one or more of the GRPC interfaces described in the API documentation , depending on the connector type. Note that a single Kubernetes service can implement all GRPC interfaces if the system it connects to supports the required functionality, but it can also be different services. In addition, to benefit from the control plane security feature ensure that the Pods of your connector: 1. Have a m4d.ibm.com/componentType: connector label 1. Have a sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"true\" annotation Connector types Data catalog Mesh for Data assumes the use of an enterprise data catalog. For example, to reference a required data asset in a M4DApplication resource, you provide a link to the asset in the catalog. The catalog provides metadata about the asset such as security tags. It also provides connection information to describe how to connect to the data source to consume the data. Mesh for Data uses the metadata provided by the catalog both to enable seamless connectivity to the data and as input to making policy decisions. The data user is not concerned with any of it and just selects the data that it needs regardless of where the data resides. Mesh for Data is not a data catalog. Instead, it links to existing data catalogs using connectors. The default installation of Mesh for Data installs Katalog , a built-in data catalog using Kubernetes CRDs used for evaluation. A connector to ODPi Egeria is also available. Policy manager Enforcing data governance policies requires a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that dictates what enforcement actions need to take place. Mesh for Data supports a wide and extendible set of enforcement actions to perform on data read, write or copy. These include transformation of data, verification of the data, and various restrictions on the external activity of an application that can acceess the data. A PDP returns a list of enforcement actions given a set of policies and specific context about the application and the data it uses. Mesh for Data includes a PDP that is powered by Open Policy Agent (OPA). However, the PDP can also use external policy managers via connectors, to cover some or even all policy types. Policies are therefore defined externally in the policy manager of choice. Mesh for Data provides a package to help writing data policies in OPA. Otherwise, data stewards are expected to keep using the policy manager that they already use, as long as there is a connector to it.","title":"Connectors"},{"location":"concepts/connectors/#connectors","text":"The project currently has two extension mechanisms, namely connectors and modules.

By providing access and use of data only via the platform, Mesh for Data brings together access and governance for data, greatly reducing risk of data loss. Mesh for Data allows: Data users to use data in a self-service model without manual processes and without dealing with credentials. Use common tools and frameworks for reading from and exporting data to data lakes or data warehouses. Data stewards to control data access and data usage by applications. Use the organization's policy manager and data catalog of choice and let Mesh for Data enforce data usage policies even after data is accessed. Data operators to automate data lifecycle mangement via implicit data copies, eliminating the need for manual versioning and copying of data. How does it work? The inputs to Mesh for Data are declarative definitions with separation of aspects: Data stewards input definitions related to data governance and security Data users input definitions related to data usage in the business logic of their applications Data operators input definitions related to infrastructure and available resources Upon creation or change of any definition, Mesh for Data compiles together relevant inputs into blueprints of the data path (per application). The blueprint augments the application workload and data sources with additional services and functions packed as pluggable modules. This creates a data path that: Integrates business logic with non-functional data centric requirements such as enabling data access regardless of its physical location, caching, lineage tracking, etc. Enforce governance on the usage of data; including limiting what data the business logic can access, performing transformations as needed, controlling what the business logic can export and where to Makes data available in locations where it is needed. Thus in a multi cluster scenario it may copy data from one location to another Mesh for Data is an open solution that can be extended to work with a wide range of tools and data stores. For example, the injectable modules and the connectors to external systems (e.g., to a data catalog) can all be third party. Applications Mesh for Data considers applications as first level entities. Before running a workload, an application needs to be registred to a Mesh for Data control plane by applying a M4DApplication resource. This is the declarative definition provided by the data user. The registration provides context about the application such as the purpose for which it's running, the data assets that it needs, and a selector to identify the workload. Additional context such as geo-location is extracted from the platform. The actions taken by Mesh for Data are based on policies and the context of the application. Specifically, Mesh for Data does not consider end-users of an application. It is the responsibility of the application to implement mechanisms such as end user authentication if required, e.g. using Istio authorization with JWT . Security While the Mesh for Data handles enforcement of data governance policies, if one could access the data not through the platform then we lose control over data usage. For this reason, Mesh for Data does not let user applications ever observe data access credentials, both for externally created data assets and for data assets created by the Mesh for Data control plane and applications running in it. Instead, modules run in the data path to handle access to data, including passing the data access credentials to upstream data stores. Security is preserved by authorizing the applications based on their Pod identities. Multicluster Mesh for Data supports data paths that access data stores that are external to the cluster such as cloud managed object stores or databases as well as data stores within the cluster such as databases running in Kubernetes. All applications and modules however will run within a cluster that has Mesh for Data installed. Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios are supported out of the box by running Mesh for Data in multiple Kubernetes clusters and configuring the manager to use a multi cluster coordination mechanism such as razee.

This page describes what modules are and how they are leveraged by the control plane to build the data plane flow. What are modules? As described in the architecture page, the control plane generates a description of a data plane based on policies and application requirements. This is known as a blueprint, and includes components that are deployed by the control plane to fulfill different data-centric requirements. For example, a component that can mask data can be used to enforce a data masking policy, or a component that copies data may be used to create a local data copy to meet performance requirements, etc. Modules are the way to describe such data plane components and make them available to the control plane. A module is packaged as a Helm chart that the control plane can install to a workload's data plane. To make a module available to the control plane it must be registered by applying a M4DModule CRD. The functionality described by the module may be deployed (a) per workload, or (b) it may be composed of one or more components that run independent of the workload and its associated control plane. In the case of (a), the control plane handles the deployment of the functional component. In the case of (b) where the functionality of the module runs independently and handles requests from multiple workloads, a client module is what is deployed by the control plane. This client module passes parameters to the external component(s) and monitors the status and results of the requests to the external component(s). The following diagram shows an example with an Arrow Flight module that is fully deployed by the control plane and a second module where the client is deployed by the control plane but the ETL component providing the functionality has been independently deployed and supports multiple workloads. Components that make up a module There are several parts to a module: Optional external component(s): deployed and managed independently of Mesh for Data. Module Workload : the workload that runs once the Helm chart is installed by the control plane. Can be a client to the external component(s) or be independent. Module Helm Chart : the package containing the module workload that the control plane installs as part of a data plane. M4DModule YAML : describes the functional capabilities, supported interfaces, and has links to the Module Helm chart. Registering a module To make the control plane aware of the module so that it can be included in appropriate workload data flows, the administrator must apply the M4DModule YAML in the m4d-system namespace. This makes the control plane aware of the existence of the module. Note that it does not check that the module's helm chart exists. For example, the following registers the arrow-flight-module : kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesh-for-data/arrow-flight-module/master/module.yaml -n m4d-system When is a module used? There are three main data flows in which modules may be used: * Read - preparing data to be read and/or actually reading the data * Write - writing a new data set or appending data to an existing data set * Copy - for performing an implicit data copy on behalf of the application. The decision to do an implicit copy is made by the control plane, typically for performance or governance reasons. A module may be used in one or more of these flows, as is indicated in the module's yaml file. Control plane choice of modules A user workload description M4DApplicaton includes a list of the data sets required, the technologies that will be used to read them, and information about the location and reason for the use of the data. This information together with input from data and enterprise policies, determine which modules are chosen by the control plane. Currently the logic for choosing the modules for the data plane is as follows: 1. If the user is requesting to read data, find all the read flow related modules 1. If the data set protocol/format and the protocol/format requested by the user do not match, then make an implicit copy of the data, storing it such that it is readable via the protocol/format requested by the user. 1. If the governance action(s) required on the data set are not supported by the read module, and it is supported by the implicit copy module ... then make an implicit copy. Otherwise no need for implicit copy, and read will be done from the source directly.

The default is to use envtest. In order to run the tests in a local cluster the following environment variables can be set: NO_SIMULATED_PROGRESS = true USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER = true make -C manager test Please be aware that the controller is running locally in this case! If a controller is already deployed onto the cluster then the tests can be run with the command below. This will ensure that the tests are only creating CRDs on the cluster and checking their status: USE_EXISTING_CONTROLLER = true NO_SIMULATED_PROGRESS = true USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER = true make -C manager test Environment variables description Environment variable Default Description USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER false This variable controls if an existing K8s cluster should be used or not. If not envtest will spin up an artificial environment that includes a local etcd setup. NO_SIMULATED_PROGRESS false This variable can be used by tests that can manually simulate progress of e.g. jobs or pods. e.g. the simulated test environment from testEnv does not progress pods etc while when testing against an external Kubernetes cluster this will actually run pods. USE_EXISTING_CONTROLLER false This variable controls if a controller should be set up and run by this test suite or if an external one should be used. E.g. in integration tests running against an existing setup a controller is already existing in the Kubernetes cluster and should not be started by the test as two controllers competing may influence the test.

Steps for creating a module Implement the logic of the module you are contributing. The implementation can either be directly in the Module Workload or in an external component. If the logic is in an external component, then the module workload should act as a client - i.e. receiving paramaters from the control plane and passing them to the external component. Create and publish the Module Helm Chart that will be used by the control plane to deploy the module workload, update it, and delete it as necessary. Create the M4DModule YAML which describes the capabilities of the module workload, in which flows it should be considered for inclusion, its supported interfaces, and the link to the module helm chart. Test the new module These steps are described in the following sections in more detail, so that you can create your own modules for use by Mesh for Data. Note that a new module is maintained in its own git repository, separate from the mesh-for-data repository. Module Workload The module workload is associated with a specific user workload and is deployed by the control plane. It may implement the logic required itself, or it may be a client interface to an external component. Credential management Modules that access or write data need credentials in order to access the data store. The credentials are retrieved from HashiCorp Vault . The parameters to login to vault and to read secret are passed as part of the arguments to the module Helm chart. An example for Vault Login API call which uses the Vault parameters is as follows: $ curl -v --request POST <address>/<authPath> -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"jwt\": <module service account token>, \"role\": <role>}' An example for Vault Read Secret API call which uses the Vault parameters is as follows: $ curl --header \"X-Vault-Token: ...\" https://<address>/<secretPath> Module Helm Chart For any module chosen by the control plane to be part of the data path, the control plane needs to be able to install/remove/upgrade an instance of the module. Mesh for Data uses Helm to provide this functionality. Follow the Helm getting started guide if you are unfamiliar with Helm. Note that Helm 3.3 or above is required. Because the chart is installed by the control plane, the input values to the chart must match the relevant type of arguments . If the module workload needs to return information to the user, that information should be written to the NOTES.txt of the helm chart. For a full example see the Arrow Flight Module chart . Publishing the Helm Chart Once your Helm chart is ready, you need to push it to a OCI-based registry such as ghcr.io . This allows the control plane of Mesh for Data to later pull the chart whenever it needs to be installed. You can use the hack/make-rules/helm.mk Makefile, or manually push the chart: HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI = 1 helm registry login -u <username> <registry> helm chart save <chart folder> <registry>/<path>:<version> helm chart push <registry>/<path>:<version> M4DModule YAML M4DModule is a kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which describes to the control plane the functionality provided by the module. The M4DModule CRD has no controller. The specification of the M4DModule Kubernetes CRD is available in the API documentation . The YAML file begins with standard Kubernetes metadata followed by the M4DModule specification: apiVersion : app.m4d.ibm.com/v1alpha1 # always this value kind : M4DModule # always this value metadata : name : \"<module name>\" # the name of your new module namespace : m4d-system # control plane namespace. Always m4d-system spec : ... The child fields of spec are described next. spec.chart This is a link to a the Helm chart stored in the image registry . This is similar to how a Kubernetes Pod references a container image. See Module Helm chart for more details. spec: chart: \"<helm chart link>\" # e.g.: ghcr.io/username/chartname:chartversion spec.statusIndicators Used for tracking the status of the module in terms of success or failure. In many cases this can be omitted and the status will be detected automatically. if the Helm chart includes standard Kubernetes resources such as Deployment and Service, then the status is automatically detected. If however Custom Resource Definitions are used, then the status may not be automatically detected and statusIndicators should be specified. statusIndicators : - kind : \"<module name>\" successCondition : \"<condition>\" # ex: status.status == SUCCEEDED failureCondition : \"<condition>\" # ex: status.status == FAILED errorMessage : \"<field path>\" # ex: status.error spec.dependencies A dependency has a type and a name .

Currently supported are three data flows: read for enabling an application to read data or prepare data for being read, write for enabling an application to write data, and copy for performing an implicit data copy on behalf of the application.

However, when writing documentation you must also follow the formatting and style guidelines.","title":"Contribute Documentation"},{"location":"contribute/documentation/formatting/","text":"Formatting Standards This page shows the formatting standards for the Mesh for Data documentation. Link to other pages using relative links When linking between pages in the documentation you can simply use the regular Markdown linking syntax, including the relative path to the Markdown document you wish to link to. For example: Please see the [ project license ]( license.md ) for further details. If the target documentation file is in another directory you'll need to make sure to include any relative directory path in the link: Please see the [ project license ]( ../about/license.md ) for further details. Prefer SVG format for diagrams Place image files in the docs/static directory. Use regular Markdown syntax for images. For example: ![](../static/myimage.svg) To make localization easier and enhance accessibility, the preferred image format is SVG. We recommend to use draw.io for creating images and diagrams. Use Export as to save your image in SVG format. Keep the Include a copy of my diagram option checked to allow later loading the SVG in draw.io and be sure to check Embed images if you diagram includes any. If your diagram depicts a process, try to avoid adding the descriptions of the steps to the diagram. Instead, only add the numbers of the steps to the diagram and add the descriptions of the steps as a numbered list in the document. Ensure that the numbers on the list match the numbers on your diagram. This approach helps make diagrams easier to understand and the content more accessible. Do not wrap lines Never wrap lines after a fixed number of characters or in a middle of a senstence. Instead, configure your editor to soft-wrap when editing documentation. Do Don't This is a long line. This is a long line. Use angle brackets for placeholders Use angle brackets for placeholders in commands or code samples. Tell the reader what the placeholder represents. For example: Display information about a pod: $ kubectl describe pod <pod-name> Where <pod-name> is the name of one of your pods. Use bold to emphasize user interface elements Do Don't Click Fork . Click \"Fork\". Select Other . Select 'Other'. Use bold to emphasize important text Use bold to emphasize text that is particularly important. Avoid overusing bold as it reduces its impact and readability.

Don't use capitalization for emphasis Only use the original capitalization found in the code or configuration files when referencing those values directly. Use back-ticks `` around the referenced value to make the connection explicit. For example, use IsolationPolicy , not Isolation Policy or isolation policy . If you are not referencing values or code directly, use normal sentence capitalization, for example, \"The isolation policy configuration takes place in a YAML file.\" Use italics to emphasize new terms Do Don't A cluster is a set of nodes ...

Ignored fields. It includes many fields which are not generally honored. For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help. It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage. In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation. Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise. Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and require a REST mapping. In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it. Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous schemas. Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

Ignored fields. It includes many fields which are not generally honored. For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help. It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage. In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation. Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise. Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation and require a REST mapping. In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it. Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous schemas. Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

Mesh for Data uses the DDC to perform an action called \"implicit copy\", i.e. the movement of a data set from one data store to another with possibly some unitary transform applied to that data set. It corresponds to Step 8 in the Architecture Document (Add a link here) Data can be copied from data store to data store in a large variety of different ways, depending on the types of the data store (e.g. COS, Relational DB) and nature of the data capture (Streamed, Snapshot). This document defines the functionality as well as the boundary conditions of the data distribution controller. Goals This document introduces fundamental concepts of the data distribution component and describes a high-level API for invoking data distributions. The initial focus is on structured (tabular) data. One goal of the data distribution component is to maximize congruence across different data stores and formats by preserving not only the data content but also the structure of the data as faithfully as possible. Fully unstructured data such (e.g. \"binary content\") will also be supported but that is not the focus of the initial version. Semi-structured data will be supported on a case-by-case basis. Non-Goals The focus is on how to invoke data distribution and not the if and when. This document doesn't describe the control component that is required to decide whether, when and how often data should be copied across storage systems. Neither does the data distribution perform any policy enforcement. This is done by the component that controls the data distribution system. High-Level Design Before providing an outline of the API functionality, some fundamental concepts are defined. Data Sets and Data Assets The following definition is aligned with the terminology used in the Watson Knowledge Catalog. Data is organized into data sets and data assets. A data set is a collection of data assets that is administered by a single body using a set of policies. Both data sets and data assets are uniquely identifiable. A data set is a collection of data assets with the same structure. Some examples: A data set is data that resides in a relational database where the database tables or views form the data asset. A data set consisting of objects that reside in a COS bucket where object prefix paths that have a common format are data assets. E.g. a set of partitioned parquet files with the same schema. A data set may be formed by a set of Kafka topics where each topic contains messages in compatible format. A data asset is represented by the content of the topic. The unit of data distribution is the data asset. Data Stores A data store allows access to data sets and data assets. Each store allows to individually access data through a data store specific API, e.g. S3 API or JDBC. Additional properties that are relevant for data distribution: Granularity of data access for reading: Some systems provide access to entire data assets only. (e.g. single unpartitioned files on COS). Other storage systems support queries to retrieve a sub-set (a selection and/or projection) of an individual data assets. (e.g. queries on Db2 or partitioned/bucketed prefixes on COS) Granularity of data access for writing: Fine-granular write access is required to apply delta-updates of individual data assets, i.e. update and insert ( upsert ) operations as well as deletes on record level are needed to process streams of changes. Systems that support fine-granular updates are relational database systems, elastic search indexes, and in-memory caches. Other systems such as traditional parquet files stored on COS or HDFS only allow data assets to be updated in their entirety. More sophisticated storage formats such as Delta Lake , Apache Iceberg or Hudi extend the capabilities of parquet. Fidelity of the type system: Data stores use various different typing systems and have different data models that require type conversions as data is distributed between these systems. For example, when moving the content of an elastic search index into a relational database we are moving between two entirely different data models. In order to minimize loss of information, type specific metadata (technical metadata) may need to be preserved as separate entities. In addition, schema inference might be needed to support certain data distributions. The invoker of the DDC is assumed to have knowledge of the technical metadata present at the source data asset and of the desired technical metadata of that data asset at the target. If the invoker does not specify this the DDC will attempt to infer it where possible. In both cases the source and target technical metadata are returned as part of the result of the data distribution. If the passed source or target technical metadata is inconsistent with the data asset at the source, then the data distribution fails. The version 1.0 of the DDC supports the following data stores: Db2 LUW v10.5 or newer Apache Kafka v2.2 or newer (Raw + Confluent KTable format serialized in JSON or Avro) IBM COS with Parquet, JSON and ORC (using a Stocator based approach) Transformations The data distribution supports simple transformations and filtering such as: - Filtering of individual rows or columns based on condition clauses. - Masking of specific columns. - Encrypting/hashing of specific columns. - Sampling of a subset of rows. This is specifically for creating a derived version of a specific data asset and is NOT to enrich or combine data assets, i.e. this is a not a general purpose computation environment. Data Life-cycle The DDC moves a data asset from a source to a target data store. The copy of the data asset will be retained at the target until explicitly removed by the invoker via the DDC API. API High-level Description The API follows the custom resource definition approach (CRD) for Kubernetes. The following basic CRD types exist: - BatchTransfer : One-time or periodic transfer of a single data asset from a source data store to a destination data store. This is also called snapshotting. This is similar to a job in K8s and will inherit many features from it, e.g. the state is kept in K8s after the batch transfer has completed and must be deleted manually. - SyncTransfer : Continuous synchronization of a single data asset from a source data store to a destination data store. The main use-case is to continuously update a destination data asset as it is typically used in a streaming or change-data-capture scenario. This CRD is similar to a stateful set in K8s. Both transfer types will have the same API concerning the core transfer definitions such as: - The source data store including connection details and data asset. - The path (in Vault) to the credentials required to access the source data store. - The destination data store including connection details and data asset. - The path (in Vault) to the credentials required to access the destination data store. - Transfer properties that define parameters such as schedule, retries, transformations etc. The difference is that SyncTransfer is running continuously, BatchTransfer requires a schedule or is a one-time transfer. Initially we will limit SyncTransfer to the movement of data from Kafka to COS or from Kafka to Db2. The status of the CRD is continuously updated with the state of the data distribution. It is used to detect both success or error situations as well as freshness. It also provides transfer statistics. Using the status of the CRD a user may examine: - where data assets have been moved - when this was last successfully completed (for _BatchTransfer_s) - statistics, i.e. how long this took, how many bytes, rows etc. were transferred - what technical metadata about the data was used at the source/destination Other K8s controllers can watch the objects and subscribe to statistics or technical metadata updates and forward these changes e.g. in dashboards or WKT. Secret management The data distribution API should not define any secrets in the CRD spec in a production environment. For development and testing direct definitions can be used but in a production environment credentials shall be retrieved from the secret provider. The secret provider can be accessed via a REST API using a role and a secret name. This secret name refers to a path in vault. At the movement operator shall not create any secrets in Kubernetes that contain any credentials and credentials shall only be maintained in memory. The fetching of secrets will be executed by the datamover component. The datamover component retrieves configuration from a JSON file that is passed on as a Kubernetes secret. The goal is that vault paths can be specified in this JSON configuration file and will be substituted by values retrieved from the secret provider. The following example illustrates this mechanism: Given the example configuration file: { \"db2URL\": \"jdbc:db2//host1:1234/MYDB\", \"user\": \"myuser\" \"vaultPath\": \"/myvault/db2Password\" } and the following string in vault: {\"password\": \"mypassword\"} The substitution in the datamover will find a JSON field called vaultPath and look up the value using the secret provider. The substitution happens at the same level as the vaultPath field was found. This works whenever the data that is stored in vault is a JSON object itself. The advantage is that the in-memory configuration will be the same as in a dev/test environment after the substitution. The result of the given example after substitution will be: { \"db2URL\": \"jdbc:db2//host1:1234/MYDB\", \"user\": \"myuser\" \"password\": \"mypassword\" } This credential substitution can also be used in the options field of transformations. Error handling The data distribution API is using validation hooks to do simple checks when a CRD is created or updated. This is a first kind of error that will result in an error when creating/updating the CRD. It will specify an error message about which fields are not valid. (e.g. an invalid cron pattern for the schedule property) As validation errors are checked before objects are created they return an error via the Kubernetes API. If an error occurred during a BatchTransfer the status of the CRD will be set to FAILED and a possible error reason will show in the error field. The error messages will differ depending on the type of exception that is thrown in the internal datamover process. The internal datamover process will communicate errors to Kubernetes via a termination message . The content of the termination message will be written into the error field of the BatchTransfer . The error message shall describe the error as good as possible without any stack traces to keep it readable and displayable in a short form. Actions for possible error states: * Pending - Nothing to do. Normal process * Running - Nothing to do. Normal process * Succeeded - Possibly execute on succeeded actions (e.g. updating a catalog, ...) * Failed - Operator will try to recover. * Fatal - Operator could not recover. Possibly recreate CRD to resolve and investigate error further. Events In addition to errors the datamover application that is called by the data distribution api will publish Kubernetes events for the CRD in order to give feedback for errors and successes. Errors will contain the error message. Successful messages will contain additional metrics such as number of transferred rows or technical metadata information. API Specification The formalism to use to describe this is to be decided, possibilities are Go using kubebuilder OR CRD directly. As the definition of transfer specific parameters is the same for BatchTransfer kind and SyncTransfer kind the definition below focusses on the BatchTransfer kind. (Think of it like a pod template definition that is the same for a job or a deployment) A possible but not complete list of Go structs using kubebuilder is: // BatchTransferSpec defines the desired state of BatchTransfer type BatchTransferSpec struct { Source DataStore `json:\"source\"` Destination DataStore `json:\"destination\"` Transformation []Transformation `json:\"transformation,omitempty\"` Schedule string `json:\"schedule,omitempty\"` Image string `json:\"image\"` // Has default value from webhook ImagePullPolicy corev1.PullPolicy `json:\"imagePullPolicy\"` // Has default value from webhook SecretProviderURL string `json:\"secretProviderURL\"` // Has default value from webhook SecretProviderRole string `json:\"secretProviderRole\"` // Has default value from webhook Suspend bool `json:\"suspend,omitempty\"` // Has default value from webhook MaxFailedRetries int `json:\"maxFailedRetries,omitempty\"` // Has default value from webhook SuccessfulJobHistoryLimit int `json:\"successfulJobHistoryLimit,omitempty\"` // Has default value from webhook FailedJobHistoryLimit int `json:\"failedJobHistoryLimit,omitempty\"` // Has default value from webhook } type DataStore struct { DataAsset string `json:\"dataAsset\"` Database *Database `json:\"database,omitempty\"` S3 *S3 `json:\"s3,omitempty\"` Kafka *Kafka `json:\"kafka,omitempty\"` } type Database struct { Db2URL string `json:\"db2URL\"` User string `json:\"user\"` Password *string `json:\"password,omitempty\"` // Please use for dev/test only!

Data is organized into data sets and data assets. A data set is a collection of data assets that is administered by a single body using a set of policies. Both data sets and data assets are uniquely identifiable. A data set is a collection of data assets with the same structure. Some examples: A data set is data that resides in a relational database where the database tables or views form the data asset. A data set consisting of objects that reside in a COS bucket where object prefix paths that have a common format are data assets. E.g. a set of partitioned parquet files with the same schema. A data set may be formed by a set of Kafka topics where each topic contains messages in compatible format. A data asset is represented by the content of the topic. The unit of data distribution is the data asset.","title":"Data Sets and Data Assets"},{"location":"reference/ddc/#data-stores","text":"A data store allows access to data sets and data assets. Each store allows to individually access data through a data store specific API, e.g. S3 API or JDBC. Additional properties that are relevant for data distribution: Granularity of data access for reading: Some systems provide access to entire data assets only. (e.g. single unpartitioned files on COS). Other storage systems support queries to retrieve a sub-set (a selection and/or projection) of an individual data assets. (e.g. queries on Db2 or partitioned/bucketed prefixes on COS) Granularity of data access for writing: Fine-granular write access is required to apply delta-updates of individual data assets, i.e. update and insert ( upsert ) operations as well as deletes on record level are needed to process streams of changes. Systems that support fine-granular updates are relational database systems, elastic search indexes, and in-memory caches. Other systems such as traditional parquet files stored on COS or HDFS only allow data assets to be updated in their entirety. More sophisticated storage formats such as Delta Lake , Apache Iceberg or Hudi extend the capabilities of parquet. Fidelity of the type system: Data stores use various different typing systems and have different data models that require type conversions as data is distributed between these systems. For example, when moving the content of an elastic search index into a relational database we are moving between two entirely different data models. In order to minimize loss of information, type specific metadata (technical metadata) may need to be preserved as separate entities. In addition, schema inference might be needed to support certain data distributions. The invoker of the DDC is assumed to have knowledge of the technical metadata present at the source data asset and of the desired technical metadata of that data asset at the target. If the invoker does not specify this the DDC will attempt to infer it where possible. In both cases the source and target technical metadata are returned as part of the result of the data distribution. If the passed source or target technical metadata is inconsistent with the data asset at the source, then the data distribution fails. The version 1.0 of the DDC supports the following data stores: Db2 LUW v10.5 or newer Apache Kafka v2.2 or newer (Raw + Confluent KTable format serialized in JSON or Avro) IBM COS with Parquet, JSON and ORC (using a Stocator based approach)","title":"Data Stores"},{"location":"reference/ddc/#transformations","text":"The data distribution supports simple transformations and filtering such as: - Filtering of individual rows or columns based on condition clauses. - Masking of specific columns. - Encrypting/hashing of specific columns. - Sampling of a subset of rows.

Create a namespace for the sample Create a new Kubernetes namespace and set it as the active namespace: kubectl create namespace m4d-notebook-sample kubectl config set-context --current --namespace = m4d-notebook-sample This enables easy cleanup once you're done experimenting with the sample. Prepare a dataset to be accessed by the notebook This sample uses the Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection dataset 1 as the data that the notebook needs to read. Download and extract the file to your machine. You should now see a file named PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv . Alternatively, use a sample of 100 lines of the same dataset by downloading PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv from GitHub. Upload the CSV file to an object storage of your choice such as AWS S3, IBM Cloud Object Storage or Ceph. Make a note of the service endpoint, bucket name, and access credentials. You will need them later. Setup and upload to MinIO For experimentation you can install MinIO to your cluster instead of using a cloud service. Define variables for access key and secret key export ACCESS_KEY = \"myaccesskey\" export SECRET_KEY = \"mysecretkey\" Install Minio to the currently active namespace: kubectl create deployment minio --image = minio/minio:RELEASE.2021-02-14T04-01-33Z -- /bin/sh -ce \"/usr/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh minio -S /etc/minio/certs/ server /export\" kubectl set env deployment/minio MINIO_ACCESS_KEY = ${ ACCESS_KEY } MINIO_SECRET_KEY = ${ SECRET_KEY } kubectl wait --for = condition = available --timeout = 120s deployment/minio Create a service to expose MinIO: kubectl expose deployment minio --port 9000 Create a port-forward to connect to MinIO UI: kubectl port-forward svc/minio 9000 & Open http://localhost:9000 and login with the access key and secret key defined in step 1 Click the button in the bottom right corner and then Create bucket to create a bucket (e.g. \"demo\"). Click the button again and then Upload files to upload a file to the newly created bucket. Register the dataset in a data catalog Register the credentials required for accessing the dataset. Replace the values for access_key and secret_key with the values from the object storage service that you used and run: cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion : v1 kind : Secret metadata : name : paysim-csv type : Opaque stringData : access_key : \"${ACCESS_KEY}\" secret_key : \"${SECRET_KEY}\" EOF Then, register the data asset itself in the catalog.

The identifier of the asset is m4d-notebook-sample/paysim-csv (i.e. <namespace>/<name> ). You will use that name in the M4DApplication later. Notice the assetMetadata field above. It specifies the dataset geography and tags. These attributes can later be used in policies. Define data access policies Define an OpenPolicyAgent policy to redact the nameOrig column for datasets tagged as finance . Below is the policy (written in Rego language): package dataapi.authz import data.data_policies as dp transform[action] { description := \"Redact sensitive columns in finance datasets\" dp.AccessType() == \"READ\" dp.dataset_has_tag(\"finance\") column_names := dp.column_with_any_name({\"nameOrig\"}) action = dp.build_redact_column_action(column_names[_], dp.build_policy_from_description(description)) } In this sample only the policy above is applied. Copy the policy to a file named sample-policy.rego and then run: kubectl -n m4d-system create configmap sample-policy --from-file = sample-policy.rego kubectl -n m4d-system label configmap sample-policy openpolicyagent.org/policy = rego while [[ $( kubectl get cm sample-policy -n m4d-system -o 'jsonpath={.metadata.annotations.openpolicyagent\\.org/policy-status}' ) ! = '{\"status\":\"ok\"}' ]] ; do echo \"waiting for policy to be applied\" && sleep 5 ; done You can similarly apply a directory holding multiple rego files. Deploy a Jupyter notebook In this sample a Jupyter notebook is used as the user workload and its business logic requires reading the asset that we registered (e.g., for creating a fraud detection model).
